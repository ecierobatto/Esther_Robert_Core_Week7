# Housing Prices in Hass Consulting Company
This project is aimed at  studying the factors that affect housing prices Hass Consulting Company, using the given information on real estate properties
that was collected over the past few months. 
Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.

## The following are expected to be performed during the analysis process:

1.Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.
2.Read and explore the given dataset.
3.Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.
4.Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
5.Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.
6.Performing regression analysis.
7.Incorporate categorical independent variables into your models.
8.Check for multicollinearity
9.Provide a recommendation based on your analysis. 
10.Create residual plots for your models, and assess heteroskedasticity using Barlett's test.
11. Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements in model improvement.

## While performing the regression analysis, we will be required to perform modeling using the given regression techniques then evaluate their performance
We will be then required to provide your observations and recommendation on the suitability of each of the tested models on their appropriateness of solving the given problem. 

i) Multiple Linear Regression
ii) Quantile Regression
iii) Ridge Regression
iv) Lasso Regression
v) Elastic Net Regression

## The project will be considered successiful  if a target of between 60% and 80%  is achieved for every model  created .
